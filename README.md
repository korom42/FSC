<h1 align="center">FSC Thermal Mod - Magisk❄️</h1>
<p align="center">
 <strong>faster, smarter, cooler</strong></div>
</p>

## How it works
The default thermal cooling mechanism on Sony flagships isn't very efficient. This Mod basically starts throttling the frequencies gradually at certain optimal temperatures allowing the device to cool-down faster while maintaning a good performance. Taking as example the <code>Snapdragon 810</code> flagship series that are known for high <code>idle</code> temperatures and overheating, while resolving overheating issues, a signficant <code>25%</code> of performance is gained at the same time. All of the included modified <code>thermal-engine</code> files are based on the stock ones pulled from their correspending device's latest <code>firmware</code>, for devices that share the same <code>SoC</code> platform the base files are taken from the most recent device if they utilize the same temperature <code>sensors</code>.

## Main advantages
- Improved overall performance
- Less heat & faster cool down
- Maintain a consistent performance for extended periods of time
- Prolonged camera usage, video recording 
- Suitable for daily usage & gaming

## Disclaimer
- You are doing this at your own risk. I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research if you are unsure of how to go about something. 
- A check is performed during the installation so unless you know what you are doing, _never install this on other devices_ even if your device shares the same <code>SoC</code> platform with the supported devices.
